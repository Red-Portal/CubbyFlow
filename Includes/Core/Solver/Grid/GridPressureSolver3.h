	//! \brief Abstract base class for 2-D grid-based pressure solver.
	//!
	//! This class represents a 2-D grid-based pressure solver interface which can
	//! be used as a sub-step of GridFluidSolver2. Inheriting classes must implement
	//! the core GridPressureSolver2::Solve function as well as the helper function
	//! GridPressureSolver2::SuggestedBoundaryConditionSolver.

	public:
		//! Default constructor.
		GridPressureSolver3();

		//! Default destructor.
		virtual ~GridPressureSolver3();

		//!
		//! \brief Solves the pressure term and apply it to the velocity field.
		//!
		//! This function takes input velocity field and outputs pressure-applied
		//! velocity field. It also accepts extra arguments such as \p boundarySDF
		//! and \p fluidSDF that represent signed-distance representation of the
		//! boundary and fluid area. The negative region of \p boundarySDF means
		//! it is occupied by solid object. Also, the positive / negative area of
		//! the \p fluidSDF means it is occupied by fluid / atmosphere. If not
		//! specified, constant scalar field with std::numeric_limits<double>::max() will be used for
		//! \p boundarySDF meaning that no boundary at all. Similarly, a constant
		//! field with -std::numeric_limits<double>::max() will be used for \p fluidSDF which means it's fully
		//! occupied with fluid without any atmosphere.
		//!
		//! \param[in]    input                 The input velocity field.
		//! \param[in]    timeIntervalInSeconds The time interval for the sim.
		//! \param[inout] output                The output velocity field.
		//! \param[in]    boundarySDF           The SDF of the boundary.
		//! \param[in]    boundaryVelocity      The velocity of the boundary.
		//! \param[in]    fluidSDF              The SDF of the fluid/atmosphere.
		//! \param[in]    useCompressed         True if it uses compressed system.
