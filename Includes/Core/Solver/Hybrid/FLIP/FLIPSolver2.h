	//! \brief 2-D Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) implementation.
	//!
	//! This class implements 2-D Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) solver from the
	//! SIGGRAPH paper, Zhu and Bridson 2005. By transferring delta-velocity field
	//! from grid to particles, the FLIP solver achieves less viscous fluid flow
	//! compared to the original PIC method.

		//! means no blending and 1 means full PIC. Default is 0.
