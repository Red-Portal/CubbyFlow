			This class implements 2-D single-phase pressure solver. This solver encodes
			the boundaries like Lego blocks -- if a grid cell center is inside or
			outside the boundaries, it is either marked as occupied or not.
			In addition, this class solves single-phase flow, solving the pressure for
			selected fluid region only and treat other area as an atmosphere region.
			Thus, the pressure outside the fluid will be set to a constant value and
			velocity field won't be altered. This solver also computes the fluid
			boundary in block-like manner; If a grid cell is inside or outside the
			fluid, it is marked as either fluid or atmosphere. Thus, this solver in
			general, does not compute subgrid structure.
