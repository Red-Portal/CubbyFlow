			2-D fractional single-phase pressure solver.

			This class implements 2-D fractional (or variational) single-phase pressure
			solver. It is called fractional because the solver encodes the boundaries
			to the grid cells like anti-aliased pixels, meaning that a grid cell will
			record the partially overlapping boundary as a fractional number.
			Alternative approach is to represent boundaries like Lego blocks which is
			the case for GridSinglePhasePressureSolver2.
			In addition, this class solves single-phase flow, solving the pressure for
			selected fluid region only and treat other area as an atmosphere region.
			Thus, the pressure outside the fluid will be set to a constant value and
			velocity field won't be altered. This solver also computes the fluid
			boundary in fractional manner, meaning that the solver tries to capture the
			subgrid structures. This class uses ghost fluid method for such calculation.
